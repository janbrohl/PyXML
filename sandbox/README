The 'sandbox' module is for experimental or alpha-quality code bases.
They can be developed here until they are ready for evaluation for
inclusion in the main PyXML distribution.  This prevents iteration of
development within the core, yet also provides for public development
of new modules.

Note: a module's presence here does not imply that it *will* go into the
PyXML distribution, simply that the code will be evaluated for inclusion
when it's finished.
