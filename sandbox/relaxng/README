This source code was an attempt at implementing RELAX NG in Python,
and is no longer being developed.  It never became fully compliant
with the specification, as is apparent from the list of bugs in the
TODO file, and the performance wasn't that good.

If you want to use RELAX NG from Python, the best option is probably
libxml (http://www.xmlsoft.org), a C library that implements RELAX NG
and includes a Python interface.  Alternatively, you can invoke a
command-line processor such as Jing
(http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html) or RNV
(http://davidashen.net/rnv.html).

There's another pure-Python implementation at
http://downloads.xmlschemata.org/python/xvif/, but its completeness is
unclear.
