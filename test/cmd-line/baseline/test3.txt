xmlproc version 0.70
Parsing catalog file 'in/catalog.xml'
You must specify a system identifier if the catalog has no DOCUMENT entry

Usage:

  xvcmd.py [options] [urlstodocs]

  ---Options:  
  -c catalog:   path to catalog file to use to resolve public identifiers
  -l language:  ISO 3166 language code for language to use in error messages
  -o format:    Format to output parsed XML. 'e': ESIS, 'x': canonical XML
                and 'n': normalized XML. No data will be output if this
                option is not specified.
  urlstodocs:   URLs to the documents to parse. (You can use plain file names
                as well.) Can be omitted if a catalog is specified and contains
                a DOCUMENT entry.
  -n:           Report qualified names as 'URI name'. (Namespace processing.)
  --nowarn:     Suppress warnings.
  --entstck:    Show entity stack on errors.
  --rawxml:     Show raw XML string where error occurred.
            
  Catalog files with URLs that end in '.xml' are assumed to be XCatalogs,
  all others are assumed to be SGML Open Catalogs.

  If the -c option is not specified the environment variables XMLXCATALOG
  and XMLSOCATALOG will be used (in that order).
