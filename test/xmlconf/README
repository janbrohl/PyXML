XML Conformance Test
====================

This directory contains a script that checks SAX2 parsers against the
"XML Conformance Test Suite, v1.0, Second Edition". You can find the
necessary files at

    http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xml-conformance/xml-test-suite.html

To run the tests, get the tarball from

    http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xml-conformance/suite-v1se/xmlconf-20010315.tar.gz

and patch it using

    http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/xml/update.sh

Unpack the patched test suite in the PARENT directory of this directory,
i.e. in the "test" directory. An already patched version is available from

    http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/files/xmlconf-20010315-patched.tar.gz

Finally, run the tests, e.g. for "xmlproc":

    python sax2tests.py --validate=yes --parser=xml.sax.drivers2.drv_xmlproc >results.xml

The test results are printed to stdout in XML form, if you used the above
command, you can convert the test results to a nice looking HTML page by using 4XSLT:

    4xslt -o results.html results.xml testresults.xsl
